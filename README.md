Funbot was made just so that I can learn about the discord api in the start. The API and the features were so fun that i got interested in adding more features and eventually games. 
This was first made with JSON files for database and later added sqlite3 when i started learning sql. The codes would look less optimsed for sqlite3 because i did not want to change the flow of other funcitons and work on the same funcitons again.
I wish to add more games and functions to the bot instead of working on changing the existing codes.
I will be more than happy to merge pull requests if the changes make significant difference in performance of the bot. Please add comments along with all changes.
